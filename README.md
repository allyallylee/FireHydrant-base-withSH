# SteamVR_SDK_UE426_example
 


## what works: 
* Cybershoes and Follow Cybershoes  
* bindings load altough game name was changed  
* packaged game tested on different machine  

## issues: 
* movement not in correct direction while holding an object in either hand (same for handcontroller joysticxk and Cybershoes). It could be that movment direction is inherited from grabbed object.  

## todos:  
* enable jumping / physics
